Focus on src/data/algorithms.ts - that's where all the algorithm content lives.

Each algorithm in the algorithmCategories array has:

problem - problem description
algorithm - how it works
solution - implementation details
improvements - optimizations
codeBlocks - code examples with descriptions
detailedExplanations - interactive tooltips/modals
images - visual aids
Check src/types/algorithms.ts to see the full structure. You can use markdown-like syntax in the text fields (callouts with [CALLOUT:type], lists, etc.).
